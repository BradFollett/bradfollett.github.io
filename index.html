                <p>
                    During my time at Southern New Hampshire University studying Computer Science, I've gained a skill set and knowledge that has prepared me well for a 
                    career in the field. Completing my coursework and working on my ePortfolio has shaped my career aspirations and values. The projects and items in my 
                    ePortfolio not only showcase my technical skills but also demonstrate my ability to think creatively, solve problems, and adapt to changing industry 
                    standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One area where I've seen growth is in working effectively within a team. While most of my work was independent, my current role as a Software Engineer at 
                    Lockheed Martin Space has given me valuable experience collaborating with others. Working in an environment has improved my communication and teamwork skills, 
                    enabling me to contribute to complex projects and engage with stakeholders to deliver top-notch solutions. This hands-on experience complements what I've 
                    learned academically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My ePortfolio features a variety of skills developed through projects. For instance, my Java-based slideshow presentation demonstrates expertise in GUI design 
                    and Java programming, while a 3D graphics project using OpenGL showcases proficiency in algorithms and data structures. Furthermore, the MongoDB dashboard project 
                    illustrates my capabilities in database management and optimizing performance.
                </p>

                <div class="full-description">
                    <p>My "Top 5 Detox/Wellness Vacations" slideshow is a Java-based application created as part of my coursework in my CS-250: Software Development 
                        Lifecycle course that I completed in June 2023. This artifact represents my ability to develop a comprehensive software project that combines both 
                        functional and aesthetic elements, reflecting a real-world application of the software development lifecycle.</p>
                    <p>This project showcases my proficiency in Java programming, specifically in building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using Java Swing. This 
                        artifact features a slideshow presentation that allows users to navigate through different slides showcasing the top 5 wellness/detox destinations. I 
                        utilized CardLayout to manage the different slides and implemented custom navigation controls to enhance user interaction. Also, I 
                        integrated an automatic slide transition feature, where the slides change every five seconds, offering a seamless and engaging experience for the user.</p>
                    <p>The most significant enhancement I made to this project involved updating the navigation system. Initially, the slideshow relied solely on mouse 
                        clicks for navigation, which could disrupt the user experience. To address this, I added keyboard navigation using the left and right arrow keys, 
                        allowing users to switch between slides more intuitively. This improvement not only made the application more user-friendly but also demonstrated 
                        my ability to consider and implement user-centric design principles in software development.</p>
                    <p>Overall, this artifact is a testament to my skills in Java programming and GUI development. It aligns with the course outcomes by demonstrating my 
                        ability to design and implement software solutions that are both functional and visually appealing. The enhancements I introduced reflect my commitment 
                        to continuous improvement and my ability to refine a project to meet high standards of usability and user satisfaction.</p>

                <div class="full-description">
                    <p>My 3D scene in OpenGL was a project I created for my Computer Graphics and Visualization class, CS 330. This project showcases my expertise in graphics 
                        programming, demonstrating how I can handle algorithms and data structures to render three-dimensional objects. Using OpenGL and GLSL, I focused on 
                        developing an interactive 3D environment.</p>
                    <p>Within the scene are 3D objects, each thoroughly rendered with attention to detail and shading. I employed vertex and fragment shaders to control the 
                        object appearances incorporating lighting effects to amplify the scenes realism. The project also allows for user-controlled camera movements allowing 
                        for interaction with the 3D environment. This demanded an understanding of linear algebra and 3D graphics principles, which I effectively applied to 
                        ensure smooth and responsive controls.</p>
                    <p>My enhancements to this project focused on optimizing rendering processes and improving application performance. By refining shader programs and 
                        optimizing data structures for storing vertex information, I achieved frame rates and more efficient memory usage. These improvements reflect my 
                        problem-solving abilities and capacity to enhance software systems.</p>
                    <p>This project serves as a testament to my strengths in computer graphics and visualization. It showcases my talent for crafting engaging and technically 
                        proficient software while illustrating my dedication to honing and enhancing my projects. The OpenGL 3D Scene serves as a component of my ePortfolio, 
                        displaying my skills in sophisticated programming and graphic application design.</p>

                <div class="full-description">
                    <p>My Animal Shelter Dashboard is a project I worked on during my CS 340 Client/Server Development class. This project showcases my capability to create 
                        and execute a full stack application that combines database management with front end data visualization. It includes a MongoDB database that stores 
                        information for an animal shelter well as a JupyterDash application that offers users an interactive dashboard to manage data effectively.</p>
                    <p>In particular, the project highlights my proficiency in database management, emphasizing my adeptness in executing CRUD operations using the `pymongo` 
                        library in Python. The core of the backend represented by the `animal_shelter.py` script manages all interactions with the database to ensure storage, 
                        retrieval and manipulation of data. The user friendly interface provided by the JupyterDash application on the end allows users to interact with the 
                        database easily while presenting data in an attractive and user friendly manner.</p>
                    <p>An important improvement I implemented in this project was implementing indexing within the MongoDB database to significantly enhance query performance. 
                        This enhancement proved critical for managing datasets by reducing query times and enhancing system responsiveness. This optimization underscores my 
                        knowledge of database performance techniques and my ability to implement industry practices for system enhancement. It also shows how dedicated I am to 
                        creating scalable and effective applications for users. </p>
                    <p>This project showcases my expertise in software development and database management, reflecting my capability to design, execute, and enhance computing 
                        solutions that work well and are optimized. The improvements I made highlight my skills and commitment to providing top-notch software solutions.</p>
